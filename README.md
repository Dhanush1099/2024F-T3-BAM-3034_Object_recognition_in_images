# CIFAR-10 Image Classifier

This repository contains an image classification project that uses a deep learning model trained on the CIFAR-10 dataset. The project includes a pre-trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for accurate classification and a web application for real-time predictions.

## üìã Project Overview

The CIFAR-10 dataset is a collection of 60,000 32x32 color images divided into 10 classes, such as airplane, automobile, bird, cat, deer, dog, frog, horse, ship, and truck. This project demonstrates:
- Model training using TensorFlow/Keras.
- Real-time image classification via a Streamlit web app.
- Deployment of a pre-trained CNN model (`cnn_model.h5`).

## üöÄ Features

1. **Deep Learning Model**:
   - A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with multiple layers including convolution, pooling, flattening, and dense layers.
   - Trained to classify images into one of 10 mutually exclusive classes.

2. **Web Application**:
   - Built with Streamlit for real-time image uploads and predictions.
   - Simple interface for non-technical users.

3. **Pretrained Model**:
   - The trained CNN model (`cnn_model.h5`) is included for easy deployment.

4. **Evaluation Metrics**:
   - Accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix are used to evaluate performance.
